      body: `**Objective**: To improve AI models such as, Midjourney and DALL-E that automatically generate images based on user requests, we want to find ways to make these AI models generate high-quality content without potential biases.
      \n
      **Example Context**:
      Imagine you asked an AI system to generate an image using a simple prompt like "CEO" or "nurse." Sometimes, the AI might not offer a wide range of different images or generate content that you prefer. We want to improve this. 
      \n
      **Please vote on how to update the AI model**:
      1. **Use the current model as is**: This means that the AI will continue to generate images the way it does now.
      2. **Use additional user information**: This means that the AI will use additional user information (e.g., the demographics of the user whoâ€™s making the request) to generate a more diverse range of images.
      3. **Track and apply user preferences**: Here, the AI will keep track of user preferences as they use the AI system (e.g., which one of the generated images they prefer given a specific request).  The AI will use these preferences to generate a wider variety of images.
      4. **Add specific flags or tags in the requests**: This allows users to add specific flags (e.g., excluding any additional objects in the generated images) or tags (e.g., different art styles) to their requests, guiding the AI to either personalize the results or offer a broader range of images.
